subtitle: Why you'd want to hire me
---

My name is Justin Rivest. I have the following qualities:

- I'm a great team player.
- I'm extremely loyal to my family.
- I'm an honest person.
- I know C++, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a bit of java as well.
- I'm currently studying to become a Data Scientist and Computer Scientist at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/hire-from-lambda).
- I've worked for over a year tutoring kids in how to use all of the aforementioned languages (except C++).
- Before studying at Lambda, I studied as a Computer Science major with a minor in Digital Humanities for 2 years at [BYU](https://www.byu.edu/).


### My story

I grew up in Orem, Utah. I was number 4 of 7 kids. After graduating High School, I served a 2-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Upon returning, I went into college at BYU and studied Computer Science and Digital Humanities for 2 years. During that 2 years, I got married to my favorite person (She's super cute). After those two years at BYU, my brother-in-law recommended I switch to Lambda School. I was hesitant about it at first, but (long story short) it felt like the right thing to do. So now, I'm at Lambda studying to become a Data Scientist! I'm not quite sure yet what I want to do with Data Science, but, I have always LOVED video games! So, one path I'm currently considering is going into the video game industry as an AI specialist.
